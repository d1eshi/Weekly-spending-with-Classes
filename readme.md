# Weekly spending with Classes

Hi, this is a project realized in course [JavaScript Moderno Gu√≠a Definitiva Construye +15 Proyectos](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-moderno-guia-definitiva-construye-10-proyectos/). tThe objective of this project is that the user can manage his weekly expenses (adding, deleting expenses), and keep track of them.

## Technologies

I have used basic **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript**. Most of the styles are made in **Bootstrap**.

### Javascript

In **JavaScript** the main utility that we use are the **classes**, in this case **Budget** and **UI**, in this way we set up the functions of each **class** with a _specific objective_, in addition to taking advantage of the _constructors_ of each **Class**.
As _secondary_ utilities is the _validation of the fields_, the _operations to be performed_ for each amount _entered_ or _deleted_ by the user (_instantiating the Budget class)_.
